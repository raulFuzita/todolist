Make sure to enter a valid password. After requesting a password reset you'll get a confirmation in this popup window.<br>
You might have to wait a couple of minutes to get the email. If you don't see any email check or the spam box.

<h2 id="activateToken">Activating Token / API</h2>

<br>

You might want to synchronize or add functionalities from other vendors. For this, we provide a safe way to let your application access your tasks or share your tasks with other platforms.<br>
The group Authorization provides a switch to generate and allow access to your tasks via a token. It is important to highlight this authorization doesn't authorize external apps to access your profile information such as password, picture, and name.<br>
Whenever you want you can generate a new token or disable this option. If you have generated a token and switch off and on the previous token is no longer valid. 

<br>

![text](/public/assets/img/ducumentation/img_9.1.png)

<br>

For your safety you can't edit the token it's generated automatically. To make your life easier you can click on the little square icon on the right to copy the token, or you can also select the token and copy.

<h2 id="useAPI">Using API</h2>

<br>

If you want to test the API before integrating it with your application you can use software to send requests and pass the token in the header of the request.<br>
We don't have a sponsor or any connection with Postman service, but we recommend it since it's been a free and stable solution. We highlight we're not responsible for any function issue, bugs, or security flaws.
You can download it for free by clicking on here, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

You can also test our API on your mobile phone, download it for free  [ApiClient : REST API Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ab.apiclient&hl=en_US&gl=US). And again we highlighted we don't have any responsibility regardless of this Android App.

<br>

<h3 id="getMethod">Get Method</h3>

<br>

To test a get method you should copy the website address and add the **/api** endpoint. Go to the Headers, create a key called **Authorization** and paste in the value field your token. Make sure the request method is a get one. Click on the send **Send** button.<br>
This example was done in Postman.<br>
If you don't know how to enable and get a token to follow this <a href="#activateToken">step</a>.<br>
If you have used a valid token and place it in the request header you should get a response from the server. If you get a **Forbidden** message generate a new token and make sure the key name is correct.

<br>

<br>

<h3 id="postMethod">Post Method</h3>

<br>

To test a post method you should copy the website address and add the **/api** endpoint. Go to the Headers, create a key called **Authorization** and paste in the value field your token. Make sure the request method is a post one. Before sending a post request you have to create a called **task** with any value in the request body. This value will be your task description. Now you can press **Send** button and see the magic happening. The response should be OK or status 200. If you get a **Forbidden** messages generate a new token and make sure the key name is correct.<br>
If you don't know how to enable and get a token to follow this <a href="#activateToken">step</a>.<br>
If you have used a valid token and place it in the request header you should get a response from the server.

If you get a response **Method Not Allowed** you can troubleshoot by checking if you have only one key or if there is any spelling mistake.

<br>

![text](/public/assets/img/ducumentation/img_10.2.png)

<br>

You check if the new task was created indeed by the API. Use a get method to retrieve all objects.
If you aren't familiar with a get method you can read more about it <a href="#getMethod">here</a>.

<h3 id="putMethod">Put / Update Method</h3>

<br>

To test a put method you should copy the website address and add the **/api** endpoint. Go to the Headers, create a key called **Authorization** and paste in the value field your token. Make sure the request method is a post one. Before sending a put request to update a task you have to create two keys in the body request. One key is the targeted task ID and the second one is the task status. See an example below. It should return OK or response 200. If you get a **Forbidden** message generate a new token and make sure the key name is correct. If you don't know how to enable and get a token to follow this <a href="#activateToken">step</a>.<br>
If you have used a valid token and place it in the request header you should get a response from the server.

If you get a response **Method Not Allowed** you can troubleshoot by checking if you have only one key or if there is any spelling mistake.

<br>
